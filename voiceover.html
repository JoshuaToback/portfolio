                   <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>Joshua Toback was born in Los Angeles, California, but moved to Raleigh, North Carolina in 2007. A massive fan of LEGO and Star Wars at the time, Josh began his journey as a voice actor on YouTube where he wrote, filmed, voiced, and directed his own stop-motion animations. After a few years, Josh decided that voice acting and directing was what he enjoyed most from those projects, and decided to pursue a career in voiceover starting in 2016. Thanks to the advent of online gathering places like Discord, Josh has spent the last six years collaborating and working with fellow voice actors on several projects.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Josh takes heavy inspiration from various voice directors, and has studied under several voiceover artists to hone his craft. His ultimate goal is to become a voice director and actor in animation and video games. After moving back to Los Angeles in 2022, Josh hopes to take the next steps towards his goal of being the next voice of your new favorite character! </p>
