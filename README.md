# My Portfolio! 

## Who am I?

My name is Joshua Toback, and I'm a man who wears many hats. Fashion sense aside I'm passionate about many things, and programming is one of them. I've always had a fascination with web and game development, and this site functions in a way to help me showcase everything I do online; form web/game development to voiceover to screenwriting!
